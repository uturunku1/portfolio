      <div class="jumbotron">
        <p>I'm a Peruvian expat living and working in Portland, Oregon. I moved from Lima, where I use to be a screenwriter for TV shows. I came to the US not too long ago, following my husband, who is a native from Oregon.</p>
        <p>Here I have been working as a medical translator and interpreter. The difference between translation and interpretation is that the first one is written and the second one is oral. I spend most of my time in hospital helping the medical staff to communicate with non-english speaking patients. It is a gratifying job.</p>
        <p>However I have noticed how technologies are stealing our jobs. From been a translator, I became an "editor". Many softwares do a great job as translators, now it is only our job to edit and correct their mistakes.</p>
        <p>They say if you cannot beat them (technologies), join them. So that is what I am doing and I am excited about it. My goal is that someday in the future I can work for a company that develops technologies for interpretation and speech recognition. While Google Translate is taking big steps for <em>text</em> translation, their oral translation through speech recognition it still really behing. As a professional interpreter, I like to think that I can bring some interest ideas on how to the develop better this type of technology.</p>
